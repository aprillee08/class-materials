# Class Materials

Class notes, quizes, a common repo for everyone, updated in each class.

### How to Follow Contents of This Repository?

Each class, I will either create or merge a new folder under [weeks](./weeks/) folder, with the weeks number. This folder will contain anything regarding that class, including quizes, class materials, links, references, etc.

If there is a presentation, this will go to [presentations](./presentations/) folder.

At the end of each class, I will upload the ZIP of this repository to [Blackboard](https://saintpeters.blackboard.com/), since Blackboard is required by the school.

You should **keep this repository open** at the begining of each class, since this is the way of distribution of materials. 

You can add yourself to [watchers](https://github.com/spu-python-203/class-materials/watchers) of this repository to follow the contents on a nightly basis!

### If there is a Quiz, What You Should Fo?

You will create a branch from the latest version of this repository. The quiz question will be under the week folder, like `weeks/week 2/quiz/`. You will contribute to this folder based on the instructions.

### Questions?

Will be answered during the class session.
